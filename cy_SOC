Project Title: Security Operations Center (SOC) Monitoring

1. Project Description: The goal of this project is to monitor a network using a Security Operations Center (SOC) and respond to potential security incidents. This project should involve the following steps:

2. Monitoring: Set up a SOC to monitor the network using tools such as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention System), and other security tools. Configure the tools to collect logs and events from various sources, including network devices, servers, and endpoints. Monitor the SOC console for alerts and incidents.

3. Continuous Improvement: Implement a continuous improvement process to optimize the SOC.
