# Cybersecurity Project: Comprehensive Security Assessment for St. Luke Lutheran Community

- **Name**: Jeremiah Kusi
- **Organization**: St. Luke Lutheran Community
- **Date**: 07 November 2022

## Project Description

This project involves a comprehensive security assessment testing engagement aimed at evaluating the security posture of the St. Luke Lutheran Community's system/network. The primary objective is to identify potential vulnerabilities, exploit security weaknesses, assess the potential impact of attacks, and provide actionable recommendations for remediation.

## Project Steps

1. **Reconnaissance and Scoping:**
   - Identify the target system/network and define the engagement's scope.
   - Gather information using both passive and active reconnaissance techniques, including OSINT and network scanning, to obtain details about IP addresses, services, ports, and potential vulnerabilities.

2. **Vulnerability Assessment:**
   - Utilize automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
   - Analyze scan results to prioritize critical vulnerabilities based on severity, potential impact, and exploitability.
   - Conduct manual verification of identified vulnerabilities to ensure accuracy and assess potential risks.

3. **Exploitation and Penetration:**
   - Perform controlled exploitation attempts on identified vulnerabilities, using techniques like password cracking, SQL injection, and privilege escalation.
   - Document steps taken during exploitation to communicate the impact and severity of vulnerabilities.

4. **Reporting and Remediation:**
   - Compile a detailed report outlining findings, including vulnerability severity, potential business impact, and recommended remediation steps.
   - Collaborate with stakeholders to prioritize remediation efforts based on risk and available resources.
   - Re-test the system/network after implementing fixes to verify successful remediation.

5. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Establish a continuous monitoring program using security controls such as intrusion detection systems and regular vulnerability assessments.
   - Provide recommendations for ongoing security improvements and best practices to ensure long-term resilience.
