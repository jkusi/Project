Project Description: Conduct a comprehensive assessment testing engagement to assess the security posture of the St. Luke Lutheran Community's system/network. 
The objective is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, assess the impact of potential attacks, and provide recommendations for remediation.

Project Steps:

Reconnaissance and Scoping:
Identify the target system/network and define the scope of the engagement.
Gather information through passive and active reconnaissance techniques, such as OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and network scanning, to obtain details about 
IP addresses, services, ports, and potentially vulnerable entry points.

Vulnerability Assessment:
Utilize automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the target system/network.
Analyze the scan results to prioritize critical vulnerabilities based on severity, potential impact, and exploitability.
Conduct manual verification and validation of identified vulnerabilities to ensure accuracy and assess the potential risk they pose.

Exploitation and Penetration:
Perform controlled exploitation attempts on identified vulnerabilities, using techniques like password cracking, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), 
and privilege escalation.Gain unauthorized access to the system/network to assess the extent of compromise and potential damage.
Document the steps taken, including the exploitation process, to help stakeholders understand the impact and severity of the vulnerabilities.

Reporting and Remediation:
Compile a detailed report outlining the findings, including the severity level of each vulnerability, potential business impact, and recommended remediation steps.
Collaborate with stakeholders to prioritize the remediation efforts based on the risk level and available resources.
Re-test the system/network after implementing the recommended fixes to verify the effectiveness of the remediation actions.
Document the results of the re-testing phase to ensure the vulnerabilities have been successfully addressed.

Continuous Monitoring:
Establish a continuous monitoring program to proactively detect and respond to new vulnerabilities and emerging threats.
Implement security controls, such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), log monitoring, and regular vulnerability assessments, to maintain the security posture of the system/network.
Provide recommendations for ongoing security improvements and best practices to ensure the long-term resilience of the St. Luke Lutheran Community's infrastructure.
