# Projects Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my projects portfolio! This repository showcases my work in various IT and cybersecurity projects. Below, you'll find summaries of some of the key projects I've been involved in:

## Setting up a Cybersecurity Home Lab

### Objective

To set up a comprehensive home lab for learning and practicing cybersecurity.

### Description

Here is a step-by-step guide to setting up a cybersecurity home lab:

- Deploying a Proxmox server for efficient virtualization of machines and containers.
- Configuring a pfSense firewall with Snort and Suricata for advanced threat detection and prevention.
- Implementing Elasticsearch and Kibana to collect and analyze system logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- Installing Elastic Defend for enhanced network visibility and security against attacks.
- Deploying an Active Directory environment for user and resource management.
- Conducting regular security audits using tools like OpenVAS, Nessus, Nmap, and Metasploit.
- Deploying Security Onion for network traffic monitoring and analysis with Wireshark.

## Enchancing Cybersecurity for Small Business: Assessment and Implementation

### Objective

This project proposes to enhance the cybersecurity posture of small businesses by conducting a comprehensive assessment of their current security posture and implementing best practices to mitigate risks. The project will involve identifying vulnerabilities, making recommendations for improvement, implementing security measures, and monitoring their effectiveness.

### Project Goals:
- Identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the company's systems and infrastructure.
- Make recommendations to enhance the business's cybersecurity.
- Implement the recommendations and test their effectiveness.
- Monitor the systems to ensure sustained security.

## System Monitoring Project Plan

### Objective

The goal of this project is to establish an effective Security Operations Center (SOC) to monitor the network, respond to potential security incidents, and ensure the overall security posture of the organization.

### Description

The project involves the setup of monitoring tools, continuous improvement of the SOC, and collaboration with the project team to enhance network security.

### Project Steps

1. Monitoring Setup: Set up a SOC to monitor the network using SIEM, IDS/IPS, and other security tools.
2. Continuous Improvement: Establish a continuous improvement process for the SOC.

### Project Timeline

- **Duration**: 1 month

## Comprehensive Security Assessment

### Objective

The objective of this assessment is to identify vulnerabilities, exploit security weaknesses, assess potential attack impact, and provide recommendations for remediation.

### Steps

1. Reconnaissance and Scoping: Identify target system/network and define scope.
2. Vulnerability Assessment: Utilize automated tools and manual verification.
3. Exploitation and Penetration: Perform controlled exploitation attempts.
4. Reporting and Remediation: Compile detailed report and collaborate on fixes.
