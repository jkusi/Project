# Projects Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my projects portfolio! This repository showcases my work in various IT and cybersecurity projects. Below, you'll find summaries of some of the key projects I've been involved in:

## Enhancing Cybersecurity for Small Businesses

### Objective

The objective of this project is to enhance the cybersecurity measures for small businesses by conducting a comprehensive assessment, implementing best practices, and establishing monitoring and prevention mechanisms.

### Description

Small businesses often face vulnerabilities due to limited resources and less secure systems. This project focuses on addressing these challenges by:

- Deploying a Proxmox server for efficient virtualization of machines and containers.
- Configuring a pfSense firewall with Snort and Suricata for advanced threat detection and prevention.
- Implementing Elasticsearch and Kibana to collect and analyze system logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- Installing Elastic Defend for enhanced network visibility and security against attacks.
- Deploying an Active Directory environment for user and resource management.
- Conducting regular security audits using tools like OpenVAS, Nessus, Nmap, and Metasploit.
- Deploying Security Onion for network traffic monitoring and analysis with Wireshark.

### Project Status

The project is currently in progress, with major components successfully deployed and configured. Ongoing monitoring, testing, and fine-tuning are being performed to ensure the effectiveness of implemented measures.

## System Monitoring Project Plan

### Objective

The goal of this project is to establish an effective Security Operations Center (SOC) to monitor the network, respond to potential security incidents, and ensure the overall security posture of the organization.

### Description

The project involves the setup of monitoring tools, continuous improvement of the SOC, and collaboration with the project team to enhance network security.

### Project Steps

1. Monitoring Setup: Set up a SOC to monitor the network using SIEM, IDS/IPS, and other security tools.
2. Continuous Improvement: Establish a continuous improvement process for the SOC.

### Project Timeline

- **Duration**: 1 month

## Comprehensive Security Assessment

### Objective

The objective of this assessment is to identify vulnerabilities, exploit security weaknesses, assess potential attack impact, and provide recommendations for remediation.

### Steps

1. Reconnaissance and Scoping: Identify target system/network and define scope.
2. Vulnerability Assessment: Utilize automated tools and manual verification.
3. Exploitation and Penetration: Perform controlled exploitation attempts.
4. Reporting and Remediation: Compile detailed report and collaborate on fixes.
