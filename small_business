Project Title: Enhancing Cybersecurity for Small Businesses: Assessment and Implementation

Project Description: Small businesses are often more vulnerable to cyberattacks due to their limited resources and less secure systems. This project aims to assess the current cybersecurity status of a small business, and implement best practices to improve its security posture.

Project Goals:

Identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the company's systems and infrastructure.
Make recommendations to enhance the business's cybersecurity.
Implement the recommendations and test their effectiveness.
Monitor the systems to ensure that they remain secure.
Project Methodology:

The project will be divided into four phases:

Cybersecurity Assessment: In this phase, tools like OpenVas, Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, and John the Ripper will be used to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses 
in the company's systems and infrastructure. The Cybersecurity Framework will be used to guide the assessment process.
Recommendations and Prioritization: Based on the assessment, recommendations will be made to enhance the business's cybersecurity. These recommendations will include 
setting up firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection tools, upgrading systems, and having a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform such as Elasticsearch. 
Prioritization of these recommendations will be based on the severity and likelihood of potential cyberattacks.
Implementation: The recommendations made in the previous phase will be implemented, including the installation of firewalls and antivirus software. 
Third-party vendors will be contacted to help with the setup process. Snort and Splunk will be set up for the business, with employees trained on security best practices 
such as creating strong passwords and identifying phishing scams.
Testing and Monitoring: After implementing the security measures, the systems will be tested and monitored using automated tools such as OpenVas, Nessus, and Nmap 
to ensure effectiveness. The project will also emphasize the importance of understanding how Snort and Splunk work to maximize their potential.

Project Timeline:
The project is expected to take six months to complete.

Project Budget:
The project budget is $1,000.
