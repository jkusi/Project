## Project Title: Enhancing Cybersecurity for Small Businesses: Assessment and Implementation

## Project Description

This project aims to address the cybersecurity vulnerabilities often faced by small businesses by conducting a comprehensive assessment of their current security posture and implementing best practices to mitigate risks. The project will involve identifying vulnerabilities, making recommendations for improvement, implementing security measures, and monitoring their effectiveness.

## Project Goals

1. Identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the company's systems and infrastructure.
2. Make recommendations to enhance the business's cybersecurity.
3. Implement the recommendations and test their effectiveness.
4. Monitor the systems to ensure sustained security.

## Project Methodology

The project will be divided into four phases:

1. **Cybersecurity Assessment:**
   - Use tools such as OpenVas, Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, and John the Ripper to identify vulnerabilities.
   - Apply the Cybersecurity Framework to guide the assessment process.

2. **Recommendations and Prioritization:**
   - Provide recommendations including firewall setup, antivirus software installation, intrusion detection tools, system upgrades, and implementing a SIEM platform.
   - Prioritize recommendations based on severity and likelihood of attacks.

3. **Implementation:**
   - Implement recommendations, install firewalls and antivirus software.
   - Engage third-party vendors for assistance.
   - Set up Snort and Splunk, and train employees on security best practices.

4. **Testing and Monitoring:**
   - Test and monitor systems using tools like OpenVas, Nessus, and Nmap.
   - Emphasize understanding Snort and Splunk for effective usage.
