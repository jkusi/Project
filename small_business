Project Title: "Enhancing Cybersecurity for Small Businesses: Assessment and Implementation"

Small businesses are often more vulnerable to cyberattacks due to their limited resources and less secure systems. 
This project aims to assess the current cybersecurity status of a small business, and implement best practices to improve its security posture.

The project is divided into four phases:
Cybersecurity Assessment: In this phase, tools like OpenVas, Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, and John the Ripperwere used to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses 
in the company's systems and infrastructure. The Cybersecurity Framework was used to guide the assessment process.

Recommendations and Prioritization: Based on the assessment, recommendations were made to enhance the business's cybersecurity. 
These recommendations included setting up firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection tools, upgrading systems, and having a 
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform such as Splunk. Prioritization of these recommendations was based on the severity and 
likelihood of potential cyberattacks.

Implementation: The recommendations made in the previous phase were implemented, including the installation of firewalls and antivirus software. 
Third-party vendors were contacted to help with the setup process. Snort and Splunk were set up for the business, with employees trained on security best 
practices such as creating strong passwords and identifying phishing scams.

Testing and Monitoring: After implementing the security measures, the systems were tested and monitored using automated tools such as OpenVas, Nessus, and 
Nmap to ensure effectiveness. The project also emphasized the importance of understanding how Snort and Splunk work to maximize their potential.

In conclusion, the "Enhancing Cybersecurity for Small Businesses: Assessment and Implementation" project aims to improve the security posture of small businesses. By following the four phases outlined in this report, small businesses can significantly reduce the risk of cyberattacks and protect 
their valuable data.
