Project Title: System Monitoring

Project Description: The goal of this project is to monitor a network using a Security Operations Center (SOC) and respond to potential security incidents. This project 
should involve the following steps:

Monitoring: Set up a SOC to monitor the network using tools such as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention System), 
and other security tools. Configure the tools to collect logs and events from various sources, including network devices, servers, and endpoints. Monitor the SOC console 
for alerts and incidents.
Continuous Improvement: Implement a continuous improvement process to optimize the SOC. This includes regularly reviewing the logs and events to identify new threats 
and vulnerabilities, and updating the SOC configuration as needed.
