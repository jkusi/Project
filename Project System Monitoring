   - Configure tools to collect logs and events from network devices, servers, and endpoints.
   - Monitor the SOC console for alerts and potential security incidents.

2. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - Establish a continuous improvement process for the SOC.
   - Regularly review logs and events to identify new threats and vulnerabilities.
   - Update SOC configuration and procedures as needed to respond to evolving security challenges.
