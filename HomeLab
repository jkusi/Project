**IT Infrastructure and Security Specialist | [HomeLab] | **
- Deploy a Proxmox server. Proxmox is a free and open-source virtualization platform that allows you to create 
and manage multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical server. This is essential for a home lab, 
as it allows you to run multiple different cybersecurity tools and appliances without having to purchase multiple 
physical machines.
- Configure a pfSense firewall. pfSense is a free and open-source firewall that provides a wide range of security features, 
including intrusion detection and prevention, VPN support, and traffic shaping. It is a popular choice for home labs 
because it is easy to configure and use.
- Implement Elasticsearch and Kibana. Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine, 
and Kibana is a data visualization dashboard. Together, they can be used to collect and analyze system logs from your VMs 
and other devices on your network. This can be helpful for monitoring and troubleshooting security incidents.
- Install Elastic Defend. Elastic Defend is a commercial add-on for Elasticsearch that provides additional security features,
such as anomaly detection and threat hunting. It is not required for a home lab, but it can be helpful 
if you are serious about learning and practicing cybersecurity.
- Deploy an Active Directory environment. Active Directory is a directory service that provides user and resource management 
for Windows networks. It is not required for a home lab, but it can be helpful if you want to learn and practice Windows 
security.
- Conduct regular security audits. Security audits are important for identifying vulnerabilities and security risks 
in your network. There are a number of free and commercial security audit tools available, such as OpenVAS, Nessus, Nmap, 
and Metasploit.
- Deploy Security Onion. Security Onion is a Linux distribution that includes a variety of open-source security tools, 
such as Snort, Suricata, and Wireshark. It is a popular choice for home labs because it provides a one-stop shop 
for security monitoring and analysis.
